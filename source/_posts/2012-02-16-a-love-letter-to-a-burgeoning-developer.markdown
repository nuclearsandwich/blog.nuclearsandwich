Hello you,

How have you been? Things are alright with me. I am at times staggered by the
sheer pace of the in which we live. But it's all going to be okay because I know
you exist.

Love is a strong and scary word. It doesn't always mean the same thing and is
employed in many different contexts but the wonder and determination in your
eyes and the gears turning in your head tell me everything I need to know. I
love you and you're going to make the world better.

It's quite brazen but I want to offer you some advice. Some of it is old and
silly and I know you've heard it before but it's important to hear it anyway,
from someone who cares about you. Today that someone is me.

//

It's only okay to break the rules you know how to follow. But don't ever be
afraid to break those.

You can't learn everything from books. But you can learn a lot more than you
expect.

You will alternate between feeling completely in command and utterly clueless.
This is normal. Cultivate and cherish it.

Pick tools you can grow into. Stretching out old clothes might feel more
comfortable but you are stagnating without realizing it. That doesn't
mean you can't wear them around the house for old time's sake.

Be prepared to get a question when you want an answer, learn to answer your own
questions with questions. You will not stop asking questions, but by the time
people begin coming to you for answers, you are likely to respond with
questions.

There will be mistakes you have no choice but to make. I was warned, as I warned
you. And like me, you will eventually question and discount it as soon
as you're given half the chance. And someday when you're the one on giving the
advice, you'll smile to yourself, unable to do anything make a suggestion that
won't be taken without first being tested. This is experience, and without the
urge to test our shared knowledge and prove that it is still valid, our craft
would collapse in on itself.

//

I know it's narcissistic of me, but one of the things I love about you is how
much of myself I see in you. We're not so different as you might think. There's
but a few short months between you and I and they will likely pass without
ceremony or remark. You will simply wake up one morning and realize you're on my
side of the bed. I won't mind. Honestly, I can't wait...

It's tempting to think that things will be so different when that moment comes
for you, and so many new possibilities will be open to you, and they will, but
it won't feel that way. Because your path, and mine, is an infinite sequence of
horizons. For every peak there's a valley and the peak on the far side is
higher than dreamt possible. But I've heard there's people there, so walk with
me a while and maybe we'll meet them someday, and the peak won't feel as high.

I can be a bit of a sap, if the last eleven paragraphs weren't enough
indication. I'm glad I chose this path, and I'm ever so glad you're here with
me.

So yes, I love you, I'll tell anyone who will sit still long enough. My mind
dizzies with the thought of what the world will be like with you and me in it.

Wishing you the best,

Steven!
